# This module is the base module for the various implementations of Oboe reporting.
# Current variations as of 2014-09-10 are a c-extension, JRuby (using TraceView Java
# instrumentation) and a Heroku c-extension (with embedded tracelyzer)

  # The following accessors indicate the incoming tracing state received
  # by the rack layer.  These are primarily used to identify state
  # between the Ruby and JOboe instrumentation under JRuby.
  #
  # This is because that even though there may be an incoming
  # X-Trace request header, tracing may have already been started
  # by Joboe.  Such a scenario occurs when the application is being
  # hosted by a Java container (such as Tomcat or Glassfish) and
  # JOboe has already initiated tracing.  In this case, we shouldn't
  # pickup the X-Trace context in the X-Trace header and we shouldn't
  # set the outgoing response X-Trace header or clear context.
  # Yeah I know.  Yuck.

  # Occurs only on Jruby.  Indicates that Joboe (the java instrumentation)
  # has already started tracing before it hit the JRuby instrumentation.
  thread_local :has_incoming_context

  # Indicates the existence of a valid X-Trace request header
  thread_local :has_xtrace_header

  # This indicates that this trace was continued from
  # an incoming X-Trace request header or in the case
  # of JRuby, a trace already started by JOboe.

  # pickup_context
  #
  # Determines whether we should pickup context
  # from an incoming X-Trace request header.  The answer

  # been already started by the Java instrumentation (Joboe)
  # in which chase we don't want to do this.
