# Welcome to the SolarWindsAPM Ruby Gem


The solarwinds_apm gem provides automatic tracing and metrics for Ruby applications. 
It requires an SolarWinds account: sign up for a free trial at https://cloud.solarwinds.com.

## Documentation
https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/observability/default.htm#cshid=config-ruby-agent

## Getting started
The gem instruments the ruby language and ruby on rails frameworks. It is hosted on RubyGems, making installation as 
simple as: `gem install solarwinds_apm`.

Our ruby extension gets detailed insights out-of-the-box without any code modification. 
For a list of instrumented gems and components see https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/observability/default.htm#cshid=config-ruby-agent

Detailled installation instructions for Ruby and different frameworks like Rails, Sinatra, Padrino, and Grape can be 
found here https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/observability/default.htm#cshid=config-ruby-install

## Custom instrumentation
If you have code or a library that is not on the platform support list, use our SDK (as documented here) to customize.
